# arduino-rapidstrike
Arduino code for a nerf rapidstrike that I planned but might not ever do.

I have a VSCode Extention that colors comments depending on suffixes\
Here is the key:\
//--------------------//\
    * = Important\
    ! = Warning\
    ? = Question\
    TODO = To Do\
  //// = Strikethrough\
//--------------------//\
